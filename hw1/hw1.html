<h3><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1945/07/as-we-may-think/303881/" target="_blank">As We May Think</a> Reading</h3>
<p>I thought this article was really interesting, especially when you take into consideration that it was written in 1945, long before advanced technology existed. It's fascinating to think about how the author, Vannevar Bush was able to conceptualize a future where humans are able to think about information in the context of storing and accessing data before this technology existed. Bush saw potential in the telegram and made a point to illustrate the value of our minds and information with the advancement of technology. He also explained that the human mind will store and process information in advanced ways and that his "memex" concept is able to similarly carry out these processes.
<h3><a href="https://oldobjectsnewideas.com/_reading/Berners-Lee_LongLiveWeb2010.pdf" target="_blank">Long Live the Web</a> Reading</h3>
<p>This reading opened my eyes up to how liberating the web really is and it's something that I think a lot of us take for granted. I also do believe that we're entering a disturbing time right now where capitalism is controlling pretty much every aspect of our lives that includes web spaces and the internet with "walled gardens" that has our generation in a chokehold. I'm a huge open-data supporter, I think restricting access to information is one of the most evil things to do and this article highlights so many important topics that need to be discussed in conversations about the internet. A lot of these topics surrounding the internet are important because it imposes on our democracy and emphasizes the fact that there isn't any regulation when it comes to a problem like Net Neutrality when there should be.
