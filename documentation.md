# Project Documentation
## General Idea of Sustaine
- Purpose:
  - The purpose of this project is to compile NYC donation resources to promote sustainability and encourage charitability among New Yorkers. 
I decided to go with this topic because of how difficult I thought it was to find donation resources in NYC and I thought this would be a
useful site that compiled every resource (Drop-Off, Mail-In, Pick-Up) into one.
- Information Resources: 
  - I used several different resources for this topic and compiled my information from a bunch of websites including:
      - [https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/dsny/site/services/donate-goods](https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/dsny/site/services/donate-goods)
      - [https://www.newyorkcares.org/sites/default/files/images/u414831/Yearround-Clothing-Donations.pdf](https://www.newyorkcares.org/sites/default/files/images/u414831/Yearround-Clothing-Donations.pdf)
      - [https://climateclock.world/](https://climateclock.world/)
      - [https://happydonations.org/?zip=10021](https://happydonations.org/?zip=10021)
- What I Want To Change / Add:
  - I want to add more Mail-In resources, but unfortunately I couldn't find much more than one Mail-In Resource, so I only have on on that page.
  - I also think I might have too much information on one page and paragraphs that are too wordy and blocky on the page. I'm considering breaking
  that up into more digestible pieces of information, especially since more recently it seems like super short sentences and phrases are the way
  to go if you want to hold someone's attention.
      
## Coding Documentation
- Coding Goals:
  - As for what I wanted to learn, I'd never worked with Google Documentation and thought that this project would be the best way to implement
  Google Documentation. I decided to go with Google's Maps API since it allowed me to manipulate the map in ways that made sense for this website.
  
- What I Did:
  - I created an array of markers and looped through each marking using a for loop, like this:
  
  ![This is an image](https://github.com/gredta/web-programming/blob/main/sustaine/images/code.png)
  - I also used [formspree](https://formspree.io/) to add the forms displayed on my Submit and Contact Pages.
- How I Did It:
  - I decided to use an array of markers since I had a lot of data. I used this video for guidance and inspiration: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zxf1mnP5zcw&ab_channel=TraversyMedia
  - I definitely feel a lot more comfortable using Google Developer Tools, it's much easier than I thought it would be and I want to continue working
  on this site to practice some more tools as I learn them.
  - Here is the Google Documentation I was following to manipulate the maps with JavaScript: https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/markers?hl=en_US
- What I Want To Change / Add:
  - I will definitely be adding more markers to each borough. There were hundreds of markers, however I limited it to about 15-25 per borough (depending
  on the size of the borough).
  - I want to add more variety to my Mail-In and Pick-Up Services Pages. They seem a bit more bland compared to the other pages, which is mainly
  due to the lack of resources.
  - I might create an API for the Pick-Up Services resources. The information on that page is completely static and it seems like a good place
  for more automation since the type of data in each block is the same.
