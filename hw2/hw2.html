<h2>homework #2</h2>
<p>Reading about the development of technology is super interestting because when you think about it, advanced technology was created and is still always being created with its main purpose being to further our capitalist society. I find it really interesting how people are able to use advanced technology to create art and inspire others. The desire to always want to create art is something I feel is so human and completely disconnected from the intended purposes of advanced technology, and it's something I find really admirable. I'm not an artist at all so I have no idea how to express myself with art, let alone digital art, so I just created a simple p5 sketch with a phrase rotating around a blank canvas.</p>
