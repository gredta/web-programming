<h2>Live Sustainably.</h2>
<p>The general idea for my project is a website called Sustaine. As a New Yorker, I find it hard to find donation
    locations a lot of the time and the donation locations that do exist don't really have a lot of information about
    the charity, what we can donate, and other useful resources involving donations. I want to generate an Google Maps API that
    compiles local NYC donations and charities where New Yorkers can drop off clothes and get a good idea of where their
    old clothes are going as well as to promote sustainability in fashion and encourage charitability among users. </p>

<p>I added a marker in each borough for drop-off sites in NYC and will continue to research more drop-off location centers. I'm
    also planning on including mailing donation information for people who would rather ship their donations instead of
    going to their physical donation site. I'll be compiling a list of mailing addresses that accept donations and local
    USPS offices. I also plan on making this project a bit more functional and have a search bar where users can enter in 
    their ZIP codes and the map will show them their own local donation drop off sites, instead of the entire map of NYC,
    and I also may include an option that allows people to mark a donation site that may not be listed on the map already.
