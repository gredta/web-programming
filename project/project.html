<h2>project overview</h2>
<p>The general idea for my project is a website called Sustaine. It's a fashion e-commerce site that allows users to list their unwanted fashion items to sell and automatically donates whatever doesn't sell to a selected charity after a selected amount of days or weeks. The purpose of this site is to encourage more sustainable practices in the fashion industry, to create a less wasteful environment, as well as encourage charitability among users by giving back to the less fortunate.</p>
<p>I'll probably be using a Django framework to build this site with Python since it is what I'm most familiar with. It will have an administrative back-end system and a client-facing side with all of the listings. I want to create an interface similar to Depop's because of the functionality of it.</p>
<p>Here is a preliminary wireframe of the website: </p>
